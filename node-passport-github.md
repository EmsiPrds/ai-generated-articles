# Implementing Github Passport using Node.js

GitHub is a popular platform for hosting software projects and collaborating with others. GitHub Passport is a way to authenticate users using their GitHub account, making it easy to integrate GitHub authentication into your Node.js web application.

In this article, we will walk through the steps to implement GitHub Passport using Node.js.

## Setting Up Your GitHub Application
The first step is to create a new GitHub application. To do this, log in to your GitHub account and go to the “Developer Settings” page. Click on the “OAuth Apps” tab and then click “New OAuth App”. Fill out the required information, including the callback URL for your application.

## Install Required Packages
To use GitHub Passport, we need to install two packages: passport-github and passport. We can install both of these packages using npm:

```
npm install passport-github passport
```


## Configure Passport
Next, we need to configure Passport to use GitHub authentication. In your application file, add the following code:

```js
const passport = require('passport');
const GitHubStrategy = require('passport-github').Strategy;

passport.use(new GitHubStrategy({
clientID: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
clientSecret: GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
callbackURL: "http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback"
},
function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
// callback function
}
));
```

## Test the Authentication
Finally, we need to test the GitHub authentication. Start your Node.js application and go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/github`. This will redirect you to GitHub to authorize your application. After you authorize the application, you will be redirected back to your application and the `callback` function in the passport configuration will be called.

In conclusion, integrating GitHub Passport authentication into your Node.js application is a simple process. By following these steps, you can easily authenticate users using their GitHub account and take advantage of the many benefits of GitHub's collaborative platform.
