# Getting Started with Sphinx: A Guide to Documenting Your Python Code

Sphinx is a popular documentation generator tool that is widely used in the Python community. It can generate documentation in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and ePub. Sphinx is designed to work with multiple programming languages, including Python, C/C++, and JavaScript. In this article, we will explore how to use Sphinx to document your Python code.

## Getting started with Sphinx

To use Sphinx, you first need to install it. You can install Sphinx using pip, which is a package installer for Python. Here's how to install Sphinx using pip:

```sh
pip install sphinx
```

Once you have installed Sphinx, you can create a new documentation project using the sphinx-quickstart command. This command will prompt you to answer a few questions about your project, such as its name, version, and author. Here's how to create a new documentation project using Sphinx:

```sh
sphinx-quickstart
```

This command will create a new directory called docs in your project's root directory. The docs directory contains several files and directories, including conf.py, which is the main configuration file for your documentation project.

Documenting your code with Sphinx

To document your Python code with Sphinx, you need to create a new .rst file for each module, class, and function you want to document. An .rst file is a text file that uses reStructuredText syntax, which is a lightweight markup language used for creating documentation.

Here's an example of how to document a Python function using reStructuredText syntax:

```rst
.. py:function:: add_numbers(a, b)

   This function takes two numbers and returns their sum.

   :param a: the first number
   :type a: int
   :param b: the second number
   :type b: int
   :return: the sum of a and b
   :rtype: int
```

In this example, we are documenting a Python function called add_numbers. The .. py:function:: directive tells Sphinx that this is a Python function. The function's purpose is described in the docstring, and its parameters and return type are described using the :param and :return directives.

Building your documentation with Sphinx

Once you have documented your code using Sphinx, you can build your documentation using the sphinx-build command. This command will generate HTML files that you can view in a web browser.

Here's how to build your documentation using Sphinx:

```sh
sphinx-build -b html docs build
```

This command will generate HTML files in the build directory, which you can view by opening the index.html file in your web browser.

## Conclusion

Sphinx is a powerful documentation generator tool that makes it easy to document your Python code. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can create professional-looking documentation for your Python projects. With Sphinx, you can focus on writing great code while Sphinx takes care of the documentation.
