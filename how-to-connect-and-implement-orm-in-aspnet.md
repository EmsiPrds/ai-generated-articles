# How to Connect and Implement ORM in ASP.NET

In ASP.NET, you can use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to connect your application to a database and perform CRUD operations. Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a popular ORM for ASP.NET applications, and it supports a variety of database providers.

To connect and implement EF Core in your ASP.NET application, follow these steps:

### Install the EF Core package

First, you'll need to install the EF Core package using NuGet Package Manager. Open the Package Manager Console and run the following command:

```bash
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```

### Define your data model

Create a C# class that represents your database table(s). For example, if you have a Books table in your database, create a Book class with properties that match the table columns.

```csharp
public class Book
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
}
```

### Create a database context

A database context is a class that manages database connections and interactions. Create a database context by inheriting from the DbContext class in EF Core. In this example, we'll create a BookContext that contains a DbSet for Book objects.

```csharp
public class BookContext : DbContext
{
    public BookContext(DbContextOptions<BookContext> options) : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
}
```
### Configure the database connection

In your Startup.cs file, configure the database connection by adding the following code to the ConfigureServices method:

```csharp
services.AddDbContext<BookContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```

### Implement CRUD operations

In your controller, you can use the BookContext to perform CRUD operations. For example, to retrieve all books from the database, you can use the following code:

```csharp
public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<Book>>> GetBooks()
{
    return await _context.Books.ToListAsync();
}
```

By following these steps, you can connect and implement EF Core in your ASP.NET application to perform CRUD operations on a database.
