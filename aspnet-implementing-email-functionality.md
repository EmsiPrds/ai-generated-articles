# Implementing Email Functionality in ASP.NET


To send email in an ASP.NET application, you first need to configure the SMTP settings. This can be done in the web.config file:

```xml
<system.net>
  <mailSettings>
    <smtp from="youremail@example.com">
      <network host="smtp.example.com" port="587" userName="youremail@example.com" password="your-email-password" />
    </smtp>
  </mailSettings>
</system.net>
```

In this example, we specify the SMTP server address, port, email address and password. You can use any email service provider that supports SMTP.

### Sending Emails
Once the email configuration is set up, you can use the SmtpClient class to send emails. Here's an example of sending a simple email:

```csharp
var client = new SmtpClient();
var message = new MailMessage();
message.From = new MailAddress("youremail@example.com");
message.To.Add(new MailAddress("recipient@example.com"));
message.Subject = "Test Email";
message.Body = "This is a test email.";
client.Send(message);
```

In this example, we create a new SmtpClient object and a new MailMessage object. We then set the From address, To address, subject, and body of the email. Finally, we call the Send method of the SmtpClient object to send the email.

### Conclusion

Sending email in an ASP.NET application is easy once you have the SMTP configuration set up. With the SmtpClient class, you can send emails with ease. By following the examples above, you can add email functionality to your ASP.NET application in no time.
