# Implementing Auth Guard and Error Route Redirect to Root in Vue.js

Vue.js is a popular front-end framework that provides a flexible and powerful way to build web applications. One important aspect of building web applications is ensuring that the user is authenticated before allowing them access to certain routes, and providing an error route redirect in case something goes wrong. In this article, we will look at how to implement an auth guard and error route redirect to the root in Vue.js.

### Implementing Auth Guard
To implement an auth guard in Vue.js, you can use the beforeEach method of the Vue Router to check if the user is authenticated before allowing access to certain routes. Here's an example of how to implement an auth guard that redirects the user to the login page if they are not authenticated:

```javascript
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
const isAuthenticated = // check if user is authenticated
if (isAuthenticated) {
next()
} else {
next('/login')
}
})
```
### Implementing Error Route Redirect
To implement an error route redirect in Vue.js, you can use the catch method of the Vue Router to catch any errors that occur during navigation and redirect the user to the root. Here's an example of how to implement an error route redirect:

```javascript
router.catch(error => {
console.error(error)
router.push('/')
})
```
This code catches any errors that occur during navigation and logs them to the console. It then redirects the user to the root using the router.push method.

### Putting It All Together
To put everything together, you can include both the auth guard and error route redirect in your Vue Router configuration file, like so:

```javascript
const router = new VueRouter({
routes: [
// your routes here
]
})

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
const isAuthenticated = // check if user is authenticated
if (isAuthenticated) {
next()
} else {
next('/login')
}
})

router.catch(error => {
console.error(error)
router.push('/')
})
```

This ensures that the user is authenticated before allowing access to certain routes, and provides an error route redirect in case something goes wrong.
