| **Definition**            | Tightly integrated into the operating system. Manages system-wide software packages and dependencies.                  | Operates independently of the operating system. Manages application-specific packages within specific environments or frameworks. |
| **Integration**           | Integrated directly into the operating system. Provided by the OS distribution.                                        | Operates within specific environments or frameworks (e.g., language-specific ecosystems, development platforms).                  |
| **Scope**                 | Manages system-wide software packages and dependencies essential for the functioning of the operating system.          | Manages application-specific packages and dependencies without impacting the system as a whole.                                   |
| **Dependency Management** | Manages dependencies at the system level, ensuring compatibility and resolving conflicts between system-wide packages. | Manages dependencies at the application level, isolating them within a virtual environment or project directory.                  |
| **Updates and Upgrades**  | Handles updates and upgrades for system packages, including security patches and core system component releases.       | Manages updates and upgrades for application-specific packages within their respective environments.                              |
